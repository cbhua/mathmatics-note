# Note about Mathematical Courses
Here are some notes about mathematical courses in my university (HIT), most of them were written in **Chinese**. I created these notes during final exam preparing periods. 

Most notes may be simple but with the most important knowledge structure. I believe these notes would be useful in reviewing such courses, rather than learning. 

Since mathematical formulas are hard to type (or not so convenient), I chose to complete them by writing, on paper or iPad. For those notes in paper, I scanned them and created pdfs. 

I also write summaries about some courses in [my site](https://timegg.top), about my overall understandings.
